// VARIABLES
// A variable is like a container where data or information is stored
// It can also be seen as a box that holds info of data types or functions

// 2 types of variables
// mutable variable: means that the info inside the variable can change E.g variables with let or var
// immutable variable: means that the info inside the variable cannot be changed E.g variables with const

let varName = "I'm excited" // mutable

varNo = 456

console.log(varName);



// For variables, you need to understand the terms: declaring and assignment
// for declaring you either use var, let or const
// for assignment you use "="

let lastName; // declaration

// For constants variables, you need to declare and assign immediately, declaration alone does not work.


lastName = "Isiaih" // assignment


const firstName = "Daniel" // declare and assign to an immutable variable

console.log(firstName + " " + lastName);


// ASSIGMENT
// 1. Declare a mutable variable
// 2. Assign the mutable variable you declared to save your fav color
// 3. Declare and assign an immutable variable to save your nickname
// 4. Print to the console or terminal your saved fav color and nickname.
